RAG:it’s a technique in AI where a language model (like GPT) doesn’t rely only on its internal knowledge
 but retrieves relevant information from an external source
 (like a database, documents, or vector store) to generate more accurate and up-to-date answers.

EMBEDDINGS are numerical representations of data (like text, images, or audio) in a high-dimensional vector space. Think of them as “coordinates” that capture the meaning or semantics of the data.

Example:

Text: "I love pizza" → [0.12, -0.34, 0.88, ...] (a vector of numbers)

Text: "Pizza is my favorite food" → [0.13, -0.30, 0.90, ...]

Vectors that are semantically similar are close together in this space. So these two sentences above would have vectors close to each other.
How embeddings relate to RAG

RAG relies on retrieving relevant info. To do that efficiently, it uses embeddings:

You convert your documents or knowledge base into embeddings.

When a user asks a question, you convert the question into an embedding.

You compare the question embedding with document embeddings (usually via cosine similarity) to find the most relevant documents.

The retrieved documents are then fed to the language model to generate the final answer.

So, embeddings are basically the bridge between a query and relevant knowledge in RAG.
